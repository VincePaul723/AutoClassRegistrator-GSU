Welcome To Vince's ACR Guidance Manual

Purpose: This program was made to allow (as of now) Georgia State University students to sign up for their classes as early as possible or at any time without having to go through the process themselves! (Given the window is open of course.)

Steps

1. This step runs Chrome Debug mode, if you haven't already, please install chrome, the program ** WILL NOT** work on any other browser. Use this shortcut- "Windows Key + R", or alternatively, open "Run" in your windows search bar and enter this string: **chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\ChromeDebug"** and hit "OK"

2. Sign into PAWS and navigate to the registration page and click "Register for Classes", make sure that the term selection screen is visible. **WARNING**: Ensure that you **DO NOT** split screen Chrome with anything else when it comes time to run the program, the program won't be able to read the buttons it has to click if the screen is split, splitting the screen conceals them... NO GOOD!
 
3. Download the AutoClassReg-GUIV.exe file and run it. (The program will only open/run if the Chrome Debug Mode is open)

4. Input all the required information prompted by the program. (Refer to the test video and picture for examples)
   - Tip: Make sure you leave a space between each CRN you input; the program will not input them correctly otherwise.

5. Once you've done all the steps above, hit submit and you're good to go!

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** close your laptop/put it to sleep. The program will keep your computer awake until it has completed its task! 

Enjoy!
