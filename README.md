Welcome To Vince's ACR Guidance Manual

Purpose: This program was made to allow (as of now) Georgia State University students to sign up for their classes as early as possible or at any time without having to go through the process themselves! (Given the window is open, of course.)

Steps

1. This step runs Chrome Debug mode. If you haven't already, please install Chrome; the program ** WILL NOT** work on any other browser. Use this shortcut- "Windows Key + R", or open "Run" in your Windows search bar and enter this string: **chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="C:\ChromeDebug"** and hit "OK"

2. Sign into PAWS and navigate to the registration page, and click "Register for Classes", make sure that the term selection screen is visible. **WARNING**: Ensure that you **DO NOT** split screen Chrome with anything else when it comes time to run the program, the program won't be able to read the buttons it has to click if the screen is split, splitting the screen conceals them... NO GOOD!
 
3. Download the AutoClassReg-GUIV.exe file and run it. (The program will only open/run if the Chrome Debug Mode is open)

4. Input all the required information prompted by the program. (Refer to [ExampleUsage-Video](ExampleUsage-Video.mkv) and [FormatExample](FormatExample.png) for examples)
   - Tip: **Make sure you leave a space between each CRN you input; the program will not input them correctly otherwise. Everything but the season must be a numerical value. (Ex: Month:8, Day:4, etc.)** Try to give the school’s system a minute or two of grace (i.e., have the program run like 2 minutes after 8 am), the window might not open EXACTLY at 8:00 am- better safe than sorry.

5. Once you've done all the steps above, hit submit, and you're good to go!

**WARNING**: Do **NOT** close your laptop/put it to sleep. The program will keep your computer awake until it has completed its task! Also, **DO NOT** open any more tabs in the Chrome Debug window other than the registration tab. I believe there’s a bug where the program will try to access a different one. I will address the tab bug in the IOS update down the line, but this program is functional as it stands!

Note: After you run the program the first time, it disconnects from your browser and ends functionality. If you wish to use it again, close the program and reload it. If issues occur after reload, open your task manager, search for the executable, right-click, click "End Task", and try again.

Enjoy!
